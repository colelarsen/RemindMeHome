                        <p>Below you can see all the reminders added by all users. To interact with reminders you must be logged
                            in. Only the owner of reminders can send PUT/DELETE requests for the respected reminder. If you
                            use a tool such as Postman you can try and update or delete other people's reminders but you
                            must have the Auth Key assigned to the user upon logging in. This key is stored in local storage
                            for ease of access. If they log in on another device the old key becomes invalid and will log
                            them out when used. The account page is also auth protected with this Auth Key.</p>
                        <p>Account passwords are MD5 encrypted with a salt so the hash is non reversable. These hashes are only
                            sent to the microservice and are never sent back to the client. This ensures if there was ever
                            a data leak the password itself would never be revealed, though the account on this site would
                            still be compromised.</p>
