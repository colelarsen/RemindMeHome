                    <h6>Remind Me Bot & RemindMeHome.com</h6>
                    <p>Developed a chat bot using Node.js and the Discord API that could monitor conversations, edit text, and
                        remind users of a text/image at a given time. Remindmehome.com allows anyone to view the reminders
                        currently being tracked by Remind me Bot. Create an account to add and edit your own reminders. Remindmehome's
                        front end was created through Angular and bootstrap. The backend uses microservices running on an
                        Amazon EC2 server. There are 3 different microservices working together. The
                        <a class="nav-item" routerLink="../reminder">Reminder</a> functionality works through the User microservice and the Reminder microservice. These
                        microservices were made using Spring Boot and the database is an AWS Dynamodb. I used a NoSQL database
                        because it is lightweight and there are complex relationships between objects. Account action is
                        secured though an Auth Key generated every time a user logs in. This key is passed to the Reminder
                        microservice who checks with the User microservice to validate the username and auth key have a valid
                        match. This allows authentication and security with microservices.
