            </div>
            <div>I am a full stack developer currently working for Infosys. I like making personal projects and experimenting
                with new software. I really like Bootstrap for developing front end because even a person as unartistic as
                me can make a sleek website. Straight out of college I always thought I would not like web development, but
                it is growing on me.

            </div>
            <div class="text-center">
                <p>This website and all custom functionality was developed entirely by me. The webserver hosting this website
                    is a nginx server running on an AWS EC2 server. The front end of this website was made using Angular with Bootstrap.
                    The page you are currently seeing has no backend but you can check out the
                    <a class="nav-item" routerLink="reminder">Reminders</a>
                    page if you want to see a microservice in action. This page is also mobile friendly!</p>

                The "Reminders" page was made for a microservice that I developed. This page allows users of a group chat to submit and edit
                reminders. The microservice that handles these requests is hosted on the same EC2 server that this webserver
                is running on. The microservice handles the requests and interacts with a Firebase NoSQL database. The users
                are reminded by a chat bot created with discord.js. The chat bot interacts with the same microservice to
                request reminders and when the time expires it sends the user a message and deletes the reminder!

                <p>The "Resume" page was made so that you can check out what I have done and what I'm currently working on.
                    I think this is a cool way to show off a resume because you can actually interact with my projects that
                    are web api compatable!</p>
